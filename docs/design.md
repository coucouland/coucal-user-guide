Coucal is an application that can be run either as a command line tool or a HTTP service. A
single command-based architecture underlies both modes of operation, which means the functionality
is near identical.

## iCalendar and vCard

Coucal is built on standards relating to the iCalendar and vCard specifications for defining
calendaring and resource data. The iCal4j project is used to implement most of the core functionality.

## Java

Coucal requires a Java 8 runtime at minimum to be installed in the target environment. Java 11 or
higher is recommended.
