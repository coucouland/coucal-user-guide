Collections provide a way to group together similar calendar and resource data.

## Overview

Each configured Connector contains one or more collections for managing user data. For each Connector
there is a default collection that is used for commands where no collection is specified. The default
collection can be changed via the `set-default` sub-command of the Collection feature.

There are three types of collection available for storing calendar or card-based data, as well 
as attachments.

### Calendar Collections

Calendar-based data includes anything managed via the scheduler, tracker, journal and availability
features. These can all be stored in a calendar collection, along with saved templates for each of these
features.

### Card Collections

Card-based data is managed via the asset and entity functions. This data, including groups and template
can be stored in card collections.

### Attachments

Any binary and other artefacts attached to card or calendar-based data can be stored in this type of
collection. This collection type can be useful for enforcing lifecycle rules and centralized access to
attachments.
