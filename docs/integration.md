Integrations allow Coucou to send calendar and resource updates to data subscribers and attendees.
The integrations build-in to the Coucou application include:

* Email Transport (SMTP/IMAP)
* AWS Cloud-native Tooling (e.g. SQS, SNS, EventBridge, etc.)
* Direct Integration (with another Coucou instance via HTTP webhooks)
