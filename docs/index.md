# Introduction

Coucal is a calendaring and scheduling tool with a powerful command line interface. It can be used
to manage your calendars in other tools (e.g. MS Outlook, Google, etc.) and to collaborate directly
with other calendar users.

Coucal includes a tracker for task management, resource and availability management features,
journaling, and powerful template and query tooling for managing your data.

# Where's the UI?

Coucal is being developed as an API-first command-driven application for managing calendaring and
scheduling information. 

We believe the most powerful tools are those that provide APIs or command line interfaces, allowing
for integration with existing processes and systems. This is where the full potential of interoperability
is realised, and interoperability is the prime directive of Coucal, and the iCalendar standards on which it
is based.
